#   Robust Human Target Detection
A fast expanding area of computer vision, human action detection has uses in
many different sectors including video surveillance, sports analysis, healthcare
monitoring, and human-computer interaction. These systems can increase
automation, boost safety, and create new user experiences by identifying and
classifying human activities including walking, running, or standing.


Human action detection&#39;s complexity results from elements including variations
in body posture, occlusions, lighting conditions, and different camera angles.
Building a strong and precise detection system calls for sophisticated algorithms
able to handle such difficulties in actual situations.


This project aims to realize an implementation of a real-time human action
detection system based on the YOLOv8 object detection framework. Given its
accuracy and speed, we train a custom YOLOv8 model on a dataset which is
specifically tailored for three basic human actions: walking, standing, and
running. The goal is to design a scalable and effective system that can reliably
recognize and classify these actions within video streams.


With this project, we seek to prove the practical application of recent advances
in object detection for human action recognition and lay the groundwork for
further development on more complicated actions and larger datasets. The
system is intended to have lightweight components for real-time processing,
making it suitable for a multitude of practical implementations.
